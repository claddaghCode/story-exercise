## Start the app

To start the development server run `nx serve story_exercise`. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200/. Happy coding!


## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/nx-cloud/features/distribute-task-execution)
- [Learn more how to setup CI](https://nx.dev/recipes/ci)

## Explore the Project Graph
Run `nx graph` to show the graph of the workspace.
It will show tasks that you can run with Nx.

# Steps to Analyze an Angular Component for Storybook

| Step | Description                                                                                           |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | **Understand the Component's Purpose**: Identify the component's functionality and role in the app.   |
| 2    | **Examine the Component's Inputs**: List `@Input()` properties, their types, default values, and ranges/options. |
| 3    | **Identify Outputs and Events**: Review `@Output()` properties and understand their emitted events.    |
| 4    | **Inspect Methods**: Analyze public methods and their impact on the component's behavior or state.    |
| 5    | **Analyze Styling and Classes**: Check dynamic CSS classes and styling inputs like `backgroundColor`.  |
| 6    | **Review the Template**: Examine the HTML for conditional rendering, child components, and logic.      |
| 7    | **Plan Stories Based on Component States**: Identify possible states and variations to showcase in Storybook. |
| 8    | **Write Stories for Each Variation**: Create stories to demonstrate the component's functionality and states. |
| 9    | **Test Stories in Storybook**: Verify each story renders correctly and logs events in the Actions Panel. |
